# The Empowering Earth Institute  
We are happy to announce the next steps in the evolution of The Intelligent Company and the creation of the Empowering Earth Institute!

The Intelligent Company was conceptualized by a small team early this year to service the 1 billion knowledge workers of the planet, providing them with training and education on artificial intelligence to boost the productivity, efficiency, and profitability of the companies they work for. Unfortunately, executing this mission at scale would exacerbate the wealth divide and inequities of the world - it would have made the owners and shareholders of the companies they work for, already among the wealthiest 1% of the planet, even richer. Many of the decision-makers we would have been selling our services to are not moral people - they worship money and the accumulation of wealth, thinking it is okay to make millions or billions while paying minimum wage to some of their workers and not providing them with a social safety net.

## Relaunch
Today, we're pivoting and re-launching as the Empowering Earth Institute (EEI) as a global vehicle for making the world more equitable through education on artificial intelligence, permaculture design, sustainability, and the universal spiritual values of union and peace, as well as many similar disciplines. The technology of this planet is now sufficient that we can solve all of the world's problems so long as we can achieve the social adoption, permission structures, and funding that will allow us to scale and reach the 7 billion people at the base of socioeconomic pyramid.

We're looking to find 30 Co-Founders to join in this high impactful project, see more below.

We are going to use the explosion of artificial intelligence as the catalyst and tipping point that will allow us to scale and reach the world. The cat is out of the bag - there is no possibility of regulating or controlling the growth of AI. The development of AI has broken Moore's Law, reaching exponential growth and now logarithmic growth in its capacities and capabilities, and publicly available artificial superintelligence (ASI) is around the corner. The world is not ready for it - but we MUST adapt, adjust, and move forward anyway. There are already more than 400,000 AI models and tools.

It's also poised to be a [$2 trillion market by 2030](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1365145/artificial-intelligence-market-size/#:~:text=Global%20artificial%20intelligence%20market%20size%202021%2D2030&text=According%20to%20Next%20Move%20Strategy,nearly%20two%20trillion%20U.S.%20dollars.). In addition, the OECD estimate for official development assistance (ODA) from its member states alone was USD 161.2 billion in 2020.

AI is the most powerful transformational tool on the planet, but used without the guidance of morals, ethics, and values, it is potentially dangerous. Its implementation on the global scale must be guided by wisdom, love of nature, and love of one another. Hundreds of millions of people may potentially lose their livelihoods as a result of AI, and we have a responsibility to provide them with a social safety net, best understood as a universal basic income combined with access to advanced education and training.

  

We will bring education on AI and other subjects to the entire world, focused on the 7 billion people at the base of the socioeconomic pyramid, sharing the most advanced high technologies like AI, data science, blockchain, augmented reality, the IoT, 3D printing, and quantum and edge computing, combined with the most advanced low technologies such as rainwater harvesting, microgeneration of power, biogas digestors, aquaponics, and restorative agriculture, to change the world for the better.

  

To niche down and begin before scaling to other subjects, we'll use The Intelligent Company brand to focus on providing customized remote online training on how to use existing AI tools for social good organizations such as the UN, INGOs, development banks, non-profits, charities, foundations, community organizations and others about how best to utilize the world's leading, enabling them to scale their impact to new levels. Initially we'll provide training on how to choose from and use the 1,000s of various amazing AI tools already existing, providing customized training and coaching for each person and team depending on their needs.

  

We'll quickly start building scalable businesses that can use talent from developing countries, such as "Talk to a Grandparent" matching service where people could call wise elders from the Caribbean and ask for advice and life coaching, as well as cultural exchange and experiencing the global community. We'll constantly be innovating and building new teams.

  

Most of the world's problems have also been solved somewhere by someone. However, most have not achieved scale. We're all about scale.

  

We could define ourselves in many ways, but perhaps the best is that of an ultra-modern global training organization with both physical and online programs, that brings together the best existing resources, technologies, philosophies, ideas, sciences, and tools on the planet, integrates them, and shares them widely on every platform available. Education is absolutely and unquestionably the most important area that we will act in, but we will act across most sectors and domains.

  

We will guide ourselves with the universal spiritual principles of peace, love, compassion, service, integrity, respect, humility, gratitude, mindfulness, union, and oneness.

  

We will apply the best practices of governance, and we are recommending we govern ourselves as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with distributed and equitable decision-making taking place on a blockchain establishing legal entities and bank accounts in every country in the world, and having teams that speak every language on the planet. We're exploring registering the parent company as a Foundation Company DAO registered in the Cayman Islands, allowing both revenue sharing and non-profit behavior. The majority of profits will be reinvested into expanding our scale.

  

We will work to redistribute wealth equitably around the world by focusing our hiring in every developing country in the world.

  

We will practice radical transparency, making all our financial transactions open to the public.

  

We will promulgate the best practices of our future society, such as universal basic income, free education for all, universal healthcare, sustainable energy and resource management, social and racial justice, strong democracy, and social engagement.

  

We will work to adapt to and mitigate the damage of runaway climate change and ecological collapse, building community self-sufficiency and resilience.

  

# Current Global Situation

The current global situation is one of unparalleled crisis as the world faces an unprecedented crisis that threatens the stability and viability of our most essential systems. From the food we eat to the financial systems that underpin our economy, the inevitable collapse of these systems will have profound and far-reaching consequences for us all.

  

As we grapple with this crisis it is clear that our current approaches to system design and management are inadequate. We must look to nature and natural laws to guide our efforts, seeking out ways to create more resilient and adaptable systems that can weather the storms of disruption and collapse that lie ahead. We must adapt and mitigate these threats at a scale similar to the redirection of human capacity that occurred in WWII.

  

At the same time, we must also be prepared to mitigate the worst effects of this crisis and adapt to the changes that are already underway. Whether it is rising sea levels, natural disasters, or humanitarian emergencies, we must work together to find solutions that will allow us to thrive in the face of these challenges. Only by embracing deep adaptation, mitigation measures, and resilient permanent system designs can we hope to emerge from this crisis with our communities and our planet intact.

  

The world and all its systems are in a state of unparalleled crisis - our natural systems such as food production, our forests and our oceans, and our human systems such as our economic and financial systems are falling apart. Humanity is not paying attention to the impending catastrophes to come. I hold the truth to be self evident that the sea levels are rising, and that within our children's lifetimes all of our beloved beaches will be destroyed - 400+ million (5% of the global population) will lose their homes and land, some of the most expensive in the world, with devastating consequences to tourism-based economies and the insurance industry. This will especially devastate the Caribbean.

  

# The Plan

A bold plan, you might say. How can you achieve this? Very simply.

  

For 85% of the world's population, USD 500 per month is considered a livable wage, capable of feeding a family, especially if that household grows much of its own food in its backyard, and you assume no housing costs (rent or mortgage), no car payments (working from home or a bikeable distance), no healthcare costs (universal healthcare or health insurance), and 2 or more productive adults per household. Anyone who has extensively traveled in developing countries knows this to be true.

  

So we'll focus on hiring people who can live on that, even if they earn more through bonuses.

  

At USD 500 per month, a team of 20,000 staff would only cost USD 10 million per month, or USD 120 million per year.

  

That team could deliver 3 million hours of education, training, and coaching per month, allowing us to potentially reach nearly 50% of the population of our target Caribbean countries each month!

  

If we followed our original model for the Intelligent Company of charging $250 per hour to clients, that would be $750 million in revenue per month or $9 billion per year with only maybe $200 million in cost. Alternatively, we could charge much less or even work under the "gift economy" model, accepting donations of money, time in service, or in-kind donations, in exchange for our services, as our costs would only be approximately $5-10 per hour of training on average for customized remote online training and virtually free for video course delivery.

  

To diversify and expand at scale, we'll establish an AI-powered grant-writing team and apply for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of grants from government development agencies, the UN, and other international donors. We'll also set up highly profitable value-creation innovations centers physically all around the world where our staff could optionally live and work, or they could work from home.

  

We'll build physical centers in the Caribbean country first, with each permaculture designed ecovillage training centers will employ advanced technology and sustainable practices to produce high-value products that can be sold in the global market, generating revenue to fund our mission. We'll also partner with businesses and organizations that align with our values and goals, collaborating on projects that promote equity, sustainability, and social good.

  

The 25 smallest Caribbean countries represent a tiny 5 million population, ranging from some of the richest and poorest countries in the world, allowing us a variety of small ecosystems in order to scale education and other programs up to national level. Operating here primarily would help us learn what we need to scale to global markets.

  

We'd then expand to the next 75 countries, and then to all 251 countries and territories in the world.

  

To achieve our vision, we'll need a diverse team of experts, ranging from engineers, data scientists, educators, social workers, entrepreneurs, philosophers, marketers, and environmentalists. We'll recruit talent from all over the world, prioritizing underrepresented groups and marginalized communities.

  

We'll also leverage the power of AI to analyze data and generate insights that can inform our strategy and decision-making. This will help us optimize our operations, measure our impact, and continuously improve our approach. We'll use AI everywhere we can inside our own organization.

  

Ultimately, our goal is to create a more equitable and sustainable world where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive. We believe that AI and other advanced technologies can be powerful tools for achieving this vision, but only if they are used in service of the greater good. By prioritizing social impact and ethical principles, we hope to inspire others to join us in this mission and create a better future for all.

  

## EEI's Thesis

Most of the world's problems have been solved at a small scale. The 25 smallest countries and territories of the Caribbean, totalling only ~5 million people combined, represent the perfect microcosm of jurisdictions to bring focused international attention for scaling nation-level solutions. If we can bring hundreds of experts to a few of these small countries we can immediately access attention and allow our partners to scale with additional funding to the rest of the Caribbean, SIDS, LDS, and world. If we can demonstrate partnership with national governments, local governments, private sector, public sector, INGOs, local civil society, local media, social media, traditional media, and UN agencies, we should be able to use AI tools to apply for hundreds of millions in funding every year to scale.

  

## EEI's Philosophy

We must work on ourselves first and foremost before we can change anything outside ourselves. Once we're ready with our inner work, we have an obligation to improve the world at **scale**; we have an obligation to unite solutions and changemakers, increasing our reach and impact to a global level, small scale projects are nice yet insufficient. Global challenges require global scale.

  

## Apply to be a Co-Founder of The Empowering Earth Institute!

**We're looking to find 30 Co-Founders to join in this high impactful project!**

  

We're open to any and all applicants with a deadline of October 31st, 2023, selections finalized by November 7th, and our 3-month intensive training beginning January 3rd, 2024. Apply as soon as possible. Applications are being reviewed as received, with calls being scheduled with eligible candidates within 5-days.

  

Apply as soon as possible. Applications are being reviewed as received and more than half the team will be selected before the deadline.

  

If you are selected as a Co-Founder, you'll spend 3-months in person at a training program called "How to Change the World at **Scale**: Merging AI and Permaculture Paradigms with a Focus on Small Developing States in the Caribbean", an empowering and immersive program designed to equip you with the knowledge, skills, and mindset needed to become a catalyst for positive change in the world at scale. Throughout this comprehensive journey through four tropical countries, we will delve deep into the intersection of artificial intelligence, social entrepreneurship, the human mind, and nature, harnessing their combined power to create a brighter and more sustainable future for all. We'll move quickly from theory to action, with half your time in training and learning mode, and half your time in building this enterprise. We're packing 1350 hours of life-changing experiences into 90 days.

  

This training program is a holistic fusion of diverse disciplines, blending the intensity of a military boot camp, the wisdom of permaculture and yoga practices, the entrepreneurial spirit of a startup incubator, the intensity of a hackathon, and the compassion of the peace corps. Furthermore, it incorporates the resilience of disaster response, the creativity of ecovillage design, and the power of cutting-edge artificial intelligence, all committed to shaping a better self and a better world at a national level.

  

Half your training will be spent in training and learning mode, and half your time will be dedicated to building this enterprise.

  

In the first month, you'll spend a month in residency on Ometepe Island, Nicaragua, a world biosphere reserve with two volcanoes, establishing the foundations of inner work, external changemaking, and our team dynamics. Enjoy rainforests and beaches, ecovillages and conscious communities, ancient petroglyphs, and more than a dozen permaculture inspired sites.

  

By the third week, you and your fellow students will begin building The Empowering Earth Institute, The Intelligent Company, TalkToGrandma.com, and other ventures.

  

We'll work together as a team to make dreams a reality, similar to a tech incubation program, and utilize tools like AutoGPT to build and scale the organization, providing the participant with a long-term source of income.

  

During the second and third month, we'll travel to Costa Rica, Guyana, Granada, the Cayman Islands, and potentially others to explore more rainforests, beaches, and examples of sustainable development and ecotourism, and begin scoping out our physical expansion plans.

  

We were going to charge $30,000 per person for this training program, but instead if we can successfully raise $1 million we'll be able to pay all our founding team $1,000 per month for 7-months starting January 2024 while also paying for all your food, accommodations, travel and other costs.

  

After completing this 3-month intensive training and enterprise building you will emerge as a confident and conscious innovator, ready to take on the world's most pressing challenges with resilience, compassion, and intelligence. Armed with an unparalleled set of tools, you will be an agent of change, dedicated to creating a sustainable and harmonious world for present and future generations. By becoming a member of the tribe, a co-founder of this amazing project, you join a global community of changemakers united by the shared vision of a thriving and equitable planet.

  

## Beyond Training Completion March 2023

After the training program, we expect we'll move country to country as teams, establishing physical training centers in all our target countries along with our local staff. We could potentially have 25 physical permaculture designed ecovillage training facilities powered by AI setup by the end of 2024. Alternatively, you could continue to work remotely on the project from anywhere in the world, potentially running a national team with staff.
