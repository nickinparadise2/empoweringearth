The Intelligent Company is an AI Automations Agency **dedicated to becoming the dominant AI solutions agency in every developing country in the world**, focused on servicing the 7 billion people at the base of the socioeconomic pyramid with a focus on achieving UN SDGs. Our autonomous AI multi-agent system is capable of revolutionizing the way organizations operate, removing all banal and repetitive activities, allowing teams to be 10x more productive through AGI.

Our autonomous AI multi-agent system combined with education, training, coaching, and consultancy on its implementation will equip the individuals and organizations in developing countries and social good organizations to harness existing AI tools to further their objectives, whether for-profit or impact oriented.

By operating primarily out of developing countries, using the best local talent and recruiting from the diaspora, we can deliver products and services for as little as $5-$20/hour with the potential to charge $200/hour or more, providing us with a massive potential margin. By having companies prepay for annual projects combined with monthly subscription fees we'll be cashflow positive from our first project. Our world class autonomous AI agent and its first use case as an automated grant application tool provide massive diversified income and impact potential by charging clients and partners a percentage of funds raised.

By scaling the adoption of AI in developing countries we can help developing countries and their populations leapfrog into the 4th industrial revolution.

## Our Thesis
Most of the world's problems have been already been solved at a small scale and need to be scaled to national and global levels.

We will focus first on the smallest Caribbean nations, starting with Guyana and the Cayman Islands, which offer ideal testbeds for replicable solutions. Despite their small size, these countries contain the full range of environments and economies across the region. Success here can scale up to larger and more complex environments. The 25 smallest countries and territories of the Caribbean, totaling only ~5 million people combined, represent the perfect microcosm of jurisdictions to bring focused international attention for scaling nation-level solutions with low complexity.

Our strategy leverages a powerful combination of high-tech and low-tech solutions. Advanced AI tools will provide data-driven insights to model climate impacts, optimize resilience strategies, and coordinate disaster response efforts. Meanwhile, sustainable techniques like regenerative agriculture and decentralized renewable energy will strengthen community self-reliance.

If we can demonstrate partnership with national governments, local governments, private sector, public sector, INGOs, local civil society, local media, social media, traditional media, and UN agencies, we should be able to use AI tools to apply for hundreds of millions in funding every year, enabling **scale**.

## Our Philosophy
We must work on ourselves first and foremost before we can change anything outside ourselves. Once we're ready with our inner work, we have an obligation to improve the world at **scale**; we have an obligation to unite solutions and changemakers, increasing our reach and impact to a global level, small scale projects are nice yet insufficient. Global challenges require global **scale**.

## The Intelligent Company
The Intelligent Company's core offering is providing consulting, tools and training to help organizations in developing nations successfully leverage existing AI tools to further their mission. We are building our autonomous AI agent and there are already amazing no-code off-the-shelf tools for content generation, grant writing and management, project management, translation, hiring, data analysis and more.

Our secondary offering is to configure more advanced solutions, such as customized AI solutions for agriculture, education and non-profit management. For example, we can implement conversational AI chatbots to provide interactive learning for students in remote regions. Or we could apply computer vision systems to analyze crop data and provide actionable insights to farmers. They could also deploy our autonomous AI agent, Jane, to act as a virtual support team of agents to support the work of each and every human staff member. The key is pairing the right technologies with each organization's unique goals.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, The Intelligent Company will focus on democratizing access to readily available AI innovations. We're also quickly developing our own autonomous AI agents.

By operating primarily out of developing countries, using the best of local talent and recruiting from the diaspora, we can deliver services for as little as $5-$20/hour with the potential to charge $200/hour or more. Our world class autonomous AI agent and our automated grant application tool provide massive diversified income and impact potential.

Across all services, our focus on sustainability and developing world contexts sets us apart. We only recommend ethical, socially-conscious applications of AI, with a love of Free Open Source Solutions (FOSS). Our affordable rates open the door to underserved organizations. With comprehensive offerings and specialized expertise, The Intelligent Company is the AI partner the developing world needs.

## Business Model
The Intelligent Company utilizes a blended revenue model to make our AI training and consulting affordable and accessible. This includes subscriptions, hourly fees, and project-based billing.

Our **subscription retainer model** offers multi-month access to training courses and support. For a monthly fee, clients gain access to our training and coaching with constant engagement with new leading edge tools. Subscriptions allow organizations to cost-effectively build in-house AI expertise over time.

We also offer **hourly training and consulting** at competitive rates, as our costs to deliver with staff from developing countries will only be $5-20 per hour. This pay-as-you-go model provides flexibility for clients with fluctuating needs. Hourly fees give organizations the exact level of support required at the appropriate rate. We'll focus on providing individual and small group coaching at an hourly rate, helping each function in an organization implement the most appropriate AI solutions for their needs.

For **custom solutions**, we provide project-based quotes based on effort and technology. Clients pay fixed fees tied to each phase of development, allowing for predictable budgeting. Our rates for custom AI development are discounted given our focus on social impact.

We're developing our first **in-house project**, a world-class Autonomous AI Agent named Jane, built on the best practices of AutoGPT and Autogen and using Github's ticketing system to transparently manage all its activities, allow human feedback and monitoring. It will allow our clients to do things like automatically identify every funding opportunity published anywhere online, immediately drafting grant applications, and automate the writing of any type of report writing, whether financial updates, annual reports, or monthly updates. This multi-modal system will put the power of AGI in the hands of the people who can do the most good with it.

Our nonprofit and government clients can access even lower rates through our social good pricing program. We are committed to making AI accessible by reducing financial barriers and will seek grants from international donors to **scale** our reach. This diversified model maximizes flexibility in serving organizations across the spectrum of financial capacity as we can accommodate limited budgets while still generating sustainable revenue to fulfill our mission. The Intelligent Company aims to strike the perfect balance between affordability and viability. Our success will enable us to continue empowering clients with AI.

## Financial Model
We are seeking $2 million dollars in funding for The Intelligent Company:
- $500k for 3-months of training and development for a core team of 30 experts, managers, and staff.
- $500k to hire and train 100 trainers across the Caribbean at an average cost of $1,500 per month.
- $500k to establish physical training centers in Guyana and the Cayman Islands.
- $500k for 6-months intense research and development from the current engineering team.

This plan will give us a 7-month runway to get to cash flow positivity at which point our burn rate will be approximately $250k per month.

Assuming training staff are trainers capable of delivering 100 hours of training per month, this team could potentially deliver 10,000 hours of training per month at an estimated $100 per hour for monthly revenue of $1m per month. Profitability should occur in the first month of providing trainings in month 5 of the plan.

This is without revenue from retainer or subscription fees, custom solutions, grants, the autonomous AI agent, affiliate revenue, and other potential revenue streams.

## Competitive Differentiation
The Intelligent Company stands apart from competitors through our exclusive focus on bringing AI tools to organizations in developing countries to advance sustainability and social impact. Most technology firms target corporate clients in high-income markets who can pay premium rates. But we turn our attention where tech access is needed most.

Our core differentiators include:
- **Affordable Pricing**: Our rates are discounted to be accessible for non-profits, governments and small businesses in lower-income regions. US-based competitors' corporate rates would exclude our core customers. Our costs are only $5-20 per hour of service delivered.
- **Local Expertise**: Our staff will hail predominantly from developing countries, or their diaspora. This brings crucial on-the-ground insights into client needs and contexts.
- **Sustainability Mission**: Everything we do aligns with sustainable development and ethical AI use. Competitors lack this sharp focus.
- **No-Code Tools:** We build expertise in no-code AI platforms usable by non-technical users. Competitors focus on advanced coding.
- **SDG Alignment**: Our training and consulting optimize AI to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This purpose-driven approach is unique.
- **Developing World Focus**: Our entire model centers on expanding access in overlooked developing markets. Competitors remain focused on industrialized nations.
- **Autonomous AI Agents**: We are building an autonomous AI multi-model multi-agent tool for social good organizations.

This positioning provides tremendous competitive advantage. Clients get high-value services tailored to their specific needs and budget realities. We remove all barriers standing between developing communities and the benefits of AI. This laser focus on inclusive development allows The Intelligent Company to stand out as a transformative force.
